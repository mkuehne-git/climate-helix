<p>The 3D helix visualizes so differences to a temperature mean calculated for a specific month with the region of
    interest <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/">[2]</a>.
    Temperature data are shown from 1880 until the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>Each loop within the helix is divided into 12 segments, one for each month of the year.
    The distance from the center is proportional to the difference to the mean temperature for that month.</p>
